Drop scones

Categories: Desert, Bread
Yields: 30 servings
Preparation Time: 00:00

5 oz plain flour
1 large pinch of salt
2 tsps baking powder
2.5 tsps caster sugar
1 egg
1 oz butter; melted
0.25 pt milk

Heat the griddle or heavy based frying pan over a moderate heat.  Sift the
flour, salt and baking powder into a large bowl.  Add the sugar.  Make a
well in the centre and drop in the egg and melted butter.  Gradually add
the milk, mixing with a wooden spoon to give a quick smooth batter.

Lightly grease the griddle or pan and pour on little pools of the mixture
to give perfectly round cakes.  As soon as the cakes are puffed and full
of bubbles and the underside brown, flip them over with a palette knife to
brown the other side.  Serve warm.
