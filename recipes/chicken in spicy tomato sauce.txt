Chicken in Spicy Tomato Sauce

Categories: Main dish, Chicken
Yields: 4 servings
Preparation Time: 00:00

4 chicken portions
2 ounces butter
For the Sauce
4 tablespoons tomato ketchup
1 tablespoon onion; finely grated
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons wine vinegar
2 teaspoons soft brown sugar
0.5 teaspoon mustard powder
0.5 teaspoon salt
For the Garnish
bunch of watercress

Heat the grill to medium heat.

Melt the butter in a small saucepan.  Brush the chicken joints all over
with the melted butter.

Remove the grid from the grill pan and arrange the chicken pieces, skin
side down and side by side, in the bottom of the grill pan, or in a large
flame-proof gratin dish.

Grill the chicken 5 inches away from the heat for 5 minutes.  Turn the
chicken over and grill for a further 5 minutes.

Meanwhile grate the onion over a plate to catch the juice.

Put the onion into the saucepan containing the remaining melted butter.
Stir in the other sauce ingredients and simmer for 5 minutes.

Brush the chicken with the sauce and continue grilling under moderate
heat, turning and brushing with more sauce every 5 minutes until the
chicken is cooked right through, a total of 30 minutes.

If the grill pan was used, turn the chicken pieces onto a hot serving dish
and spoon the sauce on top.  Garnish with watercress.
